Template for using Vue with webpack.

vue-cli is not installed as I don't find much use for it.

Optional:
myevents uses eventemitter3 as an optional app-global event emitter.
settings.js is a barebones class for unifying app settings.

Scripts Optional:
npm build-cloud and deploy are for using firebase.


Some basic css class are included in main.css
